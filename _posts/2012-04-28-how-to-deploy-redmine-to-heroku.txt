title: How to deploy Redmine to Heroku

description: This post describes how to deploy free bugtracker Redmine 2 to free Hosting - Heroku

This post describes how to deploy absolutely free bugtracker - **Redmine** to free hosting **Heroku**. That's way you will have free bugtracker in the internet. There are many post in the internet that describe how to deploy old version of **Redmine** to **Heroku**, but I couldn't find any information how to deploy new version of **Redmine**: **Redmine 2**. So if you have the same problem - you are welcome

## Changes for Heroku

Firstly we need to clone sources from **github**:

	git clone git://github.com/redmine/redmine.git
	
Open *.gitignore* file in your favourite editor and remove lines:

	Gemfile.lock
	Gemfile.local
	public/plugin_assets
	config/initializers/session_store.rb
	config/initializers/secret_token.rb
	config/configuration.yml
	config/email.yml
	
Install gems:

	bundle install

Execute rake task to generate session token:

	rake generate_secret_token
		
Create application on the heroku:

	heroku create NAME_FOR_YOUR_APP

Make commit and push changes to heroku origin:

	git commit -am "prepare for heroku"
	git push heroku
	
Make sure that all gems was installed on the heroku server and after this run migrations there with loading default data for properly working Redmine:

	heroku run rake db:migrate
	heroku run rake redmine:load_default_data

That's all, you can test it now in the browser:

	heroku open
	
Default user for Redmine is **admin** and password is **admin** too.

## Email confirmations

Firstly add add-on on the heroku for your application:

	heroku addons:add sendgrid:starter
	
There is a limitation for free version of this add-on: *200 emails per day*. So if you have more emails for one day you have to change plan of add-on to more appropriate. For more information, please, read [add-on desription](https://addons.heroku.com/sendgrid).

Create *config/email.yml* file and add there the following changes and change user_name and password to yours:

	{{ruby}}
	production:
	  delivery_method: :smtp
	  smtp_settings:
	    address: "smtp.sendgrid.net"
	    port: 25
	    authentication: :plain
	    domain: "heroku.com"
	    user_name: "SENDGRID_USERNAME"
	    password: "SENDGRID_PASSWORD"

Push changes to the heroku:

	git commit -am "email configuration"
	gut push heroku

## Save uploaded files to Amazon S3

If you are going to add attachment to tasks or just upload files to redmine you can setup **redmine_s3** plugin: http://github.com/ka8725/redmine_s3.git](http://github.com/ka8725/redmine_s3.git). Please follow link to read instrunctions how to install it. This is my fork of original gem: **git://github.com/tigrish/redmine_s3.git**

> **NOTE:** Since **Redmine 2** has released there are many changes there and gem **git://github.com/tigrish/redmine_s3.git** is not working with it now. That's why I forked this gem and have changed it.
	
> **NOTE:** Don't forget to remove directory **plugins/redmine_s3/.git** before make commit. This plugin won't be install on the **Heroku** otherwise and you won't be able to save files to **s3**.

Push changes to the heroku:

	git commit -am "s3 configuration"
	gut push heroku


That's it - you have free bugtracker on the intenet. Check it out: [http://redmine-todo.heroku.com](http://redmine-todo.heroku.com).


## Conclusion

Bundle with **Redmine** and **Heroku** perfectly appropriate for developers who wanted to save money and have a good bugtracker. But if your project is opensource and there is no matter to hide your project in the internet you can use [free hosted redmine](http://www.hostedredmine.com/) or [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com).
