  <h2>What is that all about</h2>
  <p>
    At first, let me introduce myself. My name is Andrey Koleshko (officially Andrei Kaleshka). I reside in Belarus, Minsk, also known as the new Silicon Valley. I have worked as a software engineer for over <b>10</b> years. Most of the projects were related to <b>Rails</b>. Hence, <b>Ruby</b> and <b>JavaScript</b> are my privileged programming languages. But that does not mean I am stick to these languages forever. For example, recently I've taken courses for <b>Algorithms and Data Structures</b> where I found very useful to use Ruby's brother <b>Python</b>. In fact, in my career I've played with many different programming languages and still increasing the diversity. This, in turn, improves my <b>Ruby</b> skills since I get familiar with different techniques and paradigms from the other languages. Exactly that makes me a well skilled and seasoned software engineer capable of building quickly high quality performant applications with minimum number of bugs. Several times in the past I took place of Team Leader, was involved in application <b>architecture</b> decisions solved the actual issues. Curiosity, attention to details, developed <b>critical thinking</b>, <b>logical thinking</b> and <b>common sense</b> allow me to provide very good code reviews, for which my collegues are always grateful, because they explain not only <b>what</b> to do but also <b>why</b>, that's extremely important for them to grow on their own. Also these skills help me form a very good feedback for already functioning (or not yet) applications' code. Having in my baggage such practical knowledge as <b>Design Patterns</b>, <b>Anti-Patterns</b>, and <b>Domain Driven Design (DDD)</b> I can provide a good expertise and plans for improving the current state of development process and application code. My experience includes automation of diffent business domains: booking systems, e-commerce, payment systems, accounting, search engines, etc. I'm always ready for  enhancing my knowledge and open for constructive discussions. Especially for that I took a recommendable for everyone course called <b>Learning How to Learn</b>. I believe, foundation knowledge is the key for successful projects. Henceforth, I evolve it all over my entire life by reading books, taking courses, solving challenges.
