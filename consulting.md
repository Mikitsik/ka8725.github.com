  <h2>What is that all about</h2>
  <p>
    At first, let me introduce myself. My name is Andrey Koleshko (officially Andrei Kaleshka). I live in Belarus, Minsk, also known as the new Silicon Valley. I have worked as a software engineer for over <b>10</b> years. Most of the projects have related to <b>Rails</b>. Hence, <b>Ruby</b> and <b>JavaScript</b> are my privileged programming languages.
  </p>
  <p>
    But that does not mean I stick to these languages forever. For example, recently I've taken courses for <b>Algorithms and Data Structures</b>. I found Ruby's brother <b>Python</b> very useful there. In fact, in my career I've played with many different programming languages. And I'm still increasing the diversity. This, in turn, improves my <b>Ruby</b> skills. That's because I get familiar with different techniques and paradigms from other languages. Exactly that makes me a well skilled and seasoned software engineer. A developer capable of building high-quality performant applications with small number of bugs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Several times in the past I took place of Team Leader. I always tend to take part in application <b>architecture</b> decisions solving the actual issues. I have developed <b>curiosity</b>, <b>attention to details</b>, <b>critical</b>, and <b>logical thinking</b>. Also, I don't forget about <b>common sense</b>. This allows me to provide good code reviews. They explain not only <b>what</b> to do but also <b>why</b>, that's important for everyone to grow on their own.
  </p>
  <p>
   My baggage of knowledge is rich in <b>Design Patterns</b>, <b>Anti-Patterns</b>, and <b>Domain Driven Design (DDD)</b>. That's great for good expertise and plans for improvement of the development process and application code. My experience includes automation of different business domains. Such as booking systems, e-commerce, payment systems, accounting, search engines, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
   I'm always ready for enhancing my knowledge and open for constructive discussions. Especially for that, I took a recommendable course called <b>Learning How to Learn</b>. Foundation knowledge is the key to successful projects. Hence, I evolve it all over my entire life by reading books, taking courses, solving challenges.
